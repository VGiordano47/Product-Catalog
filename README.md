# Product-Catalog
Simple JSON consumption and DOM handling to create a slideshow for each product

-To demo, simply run the folder on a local server and navigate to the the required port.
(I simply use the 'Web Server for Chrome' Google Chrome extension, select the folder containing the project, 
then navigate to the local url by clicking the link in the extension. )

-The page will display all of the products within the JSON file, each within their own carousel.

-Captions with product name and price are loaded and placed onto the hero slides. 

-All contents (besides navigation bar) are written into the html by the javascript file (index.js)

-Comments within the index.js file explain how the objects are being broken down and inserted into the DOM

-Both arrow keys and slide indicators will move to next/previous slides. 

-The navigation bar is only for show - not functional. 

-The products are gridded out simply in rows of 3, but it is responsive and will stack into rows of 1 if the browser width is shortened.

-Styled/classed with Bootstrap.
